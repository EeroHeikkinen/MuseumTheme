<h1>About Finna</h1>

<p><em>The treasures of Finland’s archives, libraries and museums with a single search.</em></p>

<p>Finna is an easy to use online service that will merge together and make available the content and services of several memory organisations such as archives, libraries and museums.</p>

<p>Finna offers information and new insights to everyone. You can use the service to search for content such as images, documents, newspapers, research papers, videos and sound recordings on the subject of your interest. In addition you can use the digital services of archives, libraries and museums. Finna’s mission is to replace current user interfaces in such a way that users will find the information they search for through a single interface regardless of the producing organisation.</p>

<p>The test version of Finna was released on December 2012. The version features the following organisations including their content and services:<p>

<p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Jyväskylä University Library</li>
	  <li>The National Archives of Finland</li>
	  <li>The National Library of Finland</li>
	  <li>Lusto The Finnish Forest Museum and other Kantapuu Museums</li>
	  <li>Tuusula Art Museum</li>
	  <li>Finnish National Gallery</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>The development of Finna will continue in 2013. New functionalities will be added and new organisations will be gradually introduced to the service.</p>

<p>Finna is maintained by The National Library of Finland. The online service is based on open source software VuFind and developed in collaboration with archives, libraries and museums. </p>

<p>More information on Finna is available on the website of The National Digital Library project at  <a href="http://www.kdk.fi/en">www.kdk.fi/en</a></p>
